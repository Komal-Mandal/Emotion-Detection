# üòä Emotion Detection App

Welcome to the **Emotion Detection App**, a cutting-edge application designed to analyze textual data and predict the emotional tone with precision and ease. This app leverages the power of **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** to identify emotions from six categories

#- **Joy**
#- **Fear**
#- **Anger**
#- **Love**
#- **Sadness**
#- **Surprise**


# üöÄ Key Features

Multi-Emotion Detection: Classifies text into one of six emotions: Joy, Fear, Anger, Love, Sadness, and Surprise.

Deep Learning Power: Utilizes an LSTM model for contextual emotion prediction.

Interactive Web Interface: Built with Streamlit, ensuring an intuitive and responsive user experience.

Explainable Results: Displays the predicted emotion and its intensity level.


# üìö How It Works

1. Input Text**: The user provides text input in the app interface.
 
2. **Preprocessing**: Text is cleaned to remove noise (e.g., special characters) and standardized through stemming and stopword filtering.
   
3. **Feature Transformation**: The cleaned text is vectorized using a pre-trained **TF-IDF vectorizer**.
 
4. **Prediction**: The logistic regression model predicts the emotion category with an associated confidence score.
 
5. **Output Display**: Results are presented in an intuitive and interactive manner.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.

Streamlit: Web application framework.

LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow): For deep learning-based emotion detection.

scikit-learn: Used for preprocessing and traditional ML models.

NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing

The code preprocesses text by cleaning and simplifying it for analysis. It removes non-alphabetic characters, converts text to lowercase, splits it into words, removes common stopwords, and stems words to their root forms using the PorterStemmer. Finally, the cleaned words are rejoined into a single string. For example, the input "I absolutely LOVE this amazing app!!!" is transformed into "absolut love amaz app"

The predict_emotion function analyzes input text to identify its emotion. It cleans the text, transforms it into numerical features using tfidf_vectorizer, and uses a logistic regression model (lg) to predict the emotion. The predicted label is decoded into a readable emotion (e.g., "Joy") with a confidence score. For example, the input "I am so happy today!" might return "Joy" with 95% confidence.
