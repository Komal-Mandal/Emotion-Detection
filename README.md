# üòä Emotion Detection App

The Emotion Detection App is a user-friendly web application designed to identify emotions in textual data using natural language processing (NLP). It leverages machine learning models to classify input text into one of six emotional categories: Joy, Fear, Anger, Love, Sadness, Surprise.

# üöÄ Key Features

Multi-Emotion Detection: Classifies text into one of six emotions: Joy, Fear, Anger, Love, Sadness, and Surprise.

Deep Learning Power: Utilizes an LSTM model for contextual emotion prediction.

Interactive Web Interface: Built with Streamlit, ensuring an intuitive and responsive user experience.

Explainable Results: Displays the predicted emotion and its intensity level.

# üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

# 1. Text Preprocessing
Input text is cleaned by:

Removing non-alphabetic characters.

Converting to lowercase.

Removing stopwords (common words like "the", "is").

Stemming words to their root forms (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run").

# 2. Feature Extraction
Text is transformed into a numerical representation using TF-IDF Vectorization.

# 3. Emotion Classification
The processed text is passed through a logistic regression model to predict the most likely emotion.
The app also outputs the intensity level of the emotion.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.

Streamlit: Web application framework.

LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow): For deep learning-based emotion detection.

scikit-learn: Used for preprocessing and traditional ML models.

NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing

The code preprocesses text by cleaning and simplifying it for analysis. It removes non-alphabetic characters, converts text to lowercase, splits it into words, removes common stopwords, and stems words to their root forms using the PorterStemmer. Finally, the cleaned words are rejoined into a single string. For example, the input "I absolutely LOVE this amazing app!!!" is transformed into "absolut love amaz app"

The predict_emotion function analyzes input text to identify its emotion. It cleans the text, transforms it into numerical features using tfidf_vectorizer, and uses a logistic regression model (lg) to predict the emotion. The predicted label is decoded into a readable emotion (e.g., "Joy") with a confidence score. For example, the input "I am so happy today!" might return "Joy" with 95% confidence.
